# AxiomaQalcosonicW1NFCReaderAndroid
An Android app that reads data from Axioma Qualsonic W1 water meters via NFC

This is a proof of concept; later there will be a repository for reading the data via a ESP microcontroller (and a NFC module) and transferring it to a MQTT server.

Please understand that I am not a programmer, the code is not pretty, poorly documented, and a mixture of English and German.

Feel free to bring the code up to programming standards!
